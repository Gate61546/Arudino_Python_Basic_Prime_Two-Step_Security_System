Downloads:

Apps

1) Arduino IDE 2.3.4 Application
2) Python 3.12 fitting your operating system (I have a Windows 11 64-bit with an Intel I5 processor)
3) Visual Studio Code, or use your own compiler

Supports and Imports from PIPy

1) OpenCV/Keras
2) TensorFlow

5) Face_Recognition

Procedures:

Step 1 Creating a Visual Model 

1) Log on to Teachable Machine
2) Create Visual Model
3) Create two classes
4) Class 1 can involve a mixture of webcam and file uploads of a man wearing a hat or woman wearing accessories (16 Images)
5) Class 2 can involve bare face and combed hair, without cap or accessories. (16 images).
6) Once classes are created, click train model and preview function.
7) Download model files compatable with OpenCV/Keras and save to project documents. Open in Visual Studio.
8) Copy created TenorFlow program into Visual Studio into created application, and make sure it is compatable with Python and not Java. Upload into started Application and save in porject documents.

Step 2 Setting up Aduino Hardware from kit

1) Locate and grab the 4 by 4 digit keypad and grab it.
2) Locate the Blue USB Cable and Arudino Uno Board and grab them
3) Collect 8 colored connector wires from the kit
4) Plug the USB cable into the Arudino Uno and the USB 2.0 jack into your computer
5) Use the 8 wires to connect the Arudino Uno to the Keypad. Connect the end port closest to hashtag into Port 2 on the Arduino, and connect port closest to star into port 9.
   Connect ports 3-8 on the Arduino to the remaining 6 ports in the Keypad.
